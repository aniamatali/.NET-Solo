    <p>This app was created for the intention of users to keep track of inventory in their imaginary store.  You can create categories to store products under and features will be added in the future such as ratings and perhaps some filters to view specific types of products.  Currently it has full CRUD capabilities for Products but only CRD for Categories.</p>
